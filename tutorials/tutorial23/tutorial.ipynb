    "## Data generation\n",
    "In this tutorial, we'll focus on the **identification** of a dynamical system starting only from a finite set of **snapshots**.\n",
    "More precisely, we'll assume that the dynamics is governed by dynamical system written as follows:\n",
    "$$\\dot{\\boldsymbol{x}}(t)=\\boldsymbol{f}(\\boldsymbol{x}(t)),$$\n",
    "along with suitable initial conditions.\n",
    "For simplicity, we'll omit the argument of $\\boldsymbol{x}$ from this point onward.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since $\\boldsymbol{f}$ is unknown, we want to model it.\n",
    "While neural networks could be used to find an expression for $\\boldsymbol{f}$, in certain contexts - for instance, to perform long-horizon forecasting - it might be useful to have an **explicit** set of equations describing it, which would also allow for a better degree of **interpretability** of our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, we use SINDy (introduced in [this paper](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1517384113)), which we'll describe later on.\n",
    "Now, instead, we describe the system that is going to be considered in this tutorial: the **Lorenz** system.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Lorenz system is a set of three ordinary differential equations and is a simplified model of atmospheric convection.\n",
    "It is well-known because it can exhibit chaotic behavior, _i.e._, for given values of the parameters solutions are highly sensitive to small perturbations in the initial conditions, making forecasting extremely challenging.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically speaking, we can write the Lorenz equations as\n",

    "In other words, assume that we have $r$ functions which might be suitable to describe the system's dynamics (_e.g._, $x,\\, y,\\, x^2,\\, xz,\\, \\dots,\\,\\sin(x)$, $\\dots$).\n",

    "Since we are in a supervised setting, we assume that we have at our disposal the snapshot matrix $\\boldsymbol{X}$ and a matrix $\\dot{\\boldsymbol{X}}$ containing time **derivatives** at the corresponding time instances.\n",

    "That is, our optimization problem will read as follows:\n",
